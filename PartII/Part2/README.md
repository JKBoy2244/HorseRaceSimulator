# Part 2 - Graphical Horse Race Simulator (GUI version)

This folder contains the graphical version of the Horse Race Simulator using Java Swing only so this code is animated.

## Files

- **RaceGUI.java** — Collects certain user inputs for setting up the race like number of lanes, track length as well as custom outfits that affect horse's performance like lightweight shoe size and weather too.
- **RaceSimulationGUI.java** — Shows the compilation of the animated race for all of the horses including how fast it moves and the shape of the track
- **RaceStatistics.java** — Provides a race summary of the horses indivdually including average confidence, average time taken as well as the winner of the race too

## How to Compile and Run

1. Open a terminal or command prompt inside this folder.
2. Compile all Java files:
3. Run the main program starting from RaceGUI (until including RaceSimulationGUI and the RaceStatistics - extra files):

## Notes

- The user selects race settings first, then the simulation is displayed.
- Different track shapes affect how the horses move and their confidence level.
- Statistics about the race are displayed after the simulation ends.
