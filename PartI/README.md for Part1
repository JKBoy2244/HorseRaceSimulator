# Part 1 - Textual Horse Race Simulator (Text Version Only)



## Files - There's 3 main files in this part.

- **Horse.java** — Initialises and sets up the characteristics of the horse like its behaviour for example.
- **Race.java** — Compiles all the horses racing together from start to finish and successfully displays the winner.
- **HorseTest.java** — Tests how correctly the program compiles the horse's behaviour.

## How to Compile and Run

1. Open a terminal or command prompt inside this folder.
2. Run all Java files and make sure they compile successfully:

3. Run the HorseTest class to verify functionality:

4. Then compile/run the Race simulation to see how the horses racing simulate:

## Extra Notes

- Confidence levels affect how likely or unlikely a horse is to move forward. Lower the confidence level, less likely the horse is to move forward (and vice-versa).
- Race result is displayed to the console.
